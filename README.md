# ExploratExploratory Data Analysis

In this project, I went through the data analysis process and used the NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib Python libraries to investigate the No-show Appointments Dataset.

The No-show Appointments dataset contains 110,527 medical appointments with its 14 associated variables/features. Here is a brief description of the features in the dataset:

<ul>
<li>PatientId - Identification of a patient.</li>
<li>AppointmentID - Identification of each appointment.</li>  
<li>Gender - Male or Female . Female is the greater proportion, woman takes way more care of they health in comparison to man.</li>
<li>ScheduledDay - The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor.</li>
<li>AppointmentDay - The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before appointment of course.</li>
<li>Age - How old is the patient.</li>
<li>Neighbourhood - The location of the hospital.</li>
<li>Scholarship - True or False. Whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian Welfare Program (Bolsa Familia).</li>
<li>Hipertension - True or False.</li>

<li>Handcap - True or False.</li>
<li>SMS_received - 1 or more messages sent to the patient.</li>
<li>No-show - True or False. This is treated as the dependent variable.</li>
</ul>
